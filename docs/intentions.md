## Intentions
We would like to demonstrate the expo features, we would like add these features

### Stack Navigation
1 **Implement THREE stack navigators**: one for the Tests, one for the Home and one for the Settings.
2. **Implement local DB for the Tests**: We will use the local DB using SQLite to store the tests and the results of the tests.
3. **Consistent UI**: We will use the same UI for the tests, the home and the settings such as header, footer and the background color.
